Write a Python script that takes your GitHub credentials
(username and password) and uses the GitHub API to display your id

- You must use Basic Authentication with a
  personal access token as password to access to your information
  (only read:user permission is needed)
- The first argument will be your username
- The second argument will be your password
  (in your case, a personal access token as password)
- You must use the package requests and sys
- You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
- You donâ€™t need to check arguments passed to the script (number or type)
